## 📓 Overview
The fictional chief product officer (CPO) at Adventure Works wants to optimize products dashboards to make decisions on the least selling products, enhance the customer experience, and boost regional sales. The CPO needs an overview of the product data that is available from any device, and this product delves into optimizing a dashboard for mobile devices. The final mobile layout provides a clear overview of the product data for the CPO to make informed decisions from their cellular device. 

## 🗒️ Getting Started
Open the Power BI report. Review the visuals, and determine that the table visual is not suited for a mobile layout. Publish the report to your Power BI Service workspace for implementing visuals in the dashboard.

Create a new dashboard named "Product Sales". To pins visuals from the Power BI report, select the report in your workspace. Hover over a visual and then select the pin icon in the top right. Select the new dashboard from dropdown. Repeat this process for all appropriate visuals.
