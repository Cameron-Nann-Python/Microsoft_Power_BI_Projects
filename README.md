## Key Performance Indicators

- Total Sales (Sum of SalesAmount)
- Average Sales (Average of SalesAmount)
- Monthly Sales (Sum of SalesAmount by Month)
- Total Orders (Count of SalesID)
- Total Marketing Expenditure (Sum of MarketingSpend)
- Monthly Marketing Expenditure (Sum of MarketingSpend by Month)

## Project Report

From May to July, total sales reached $1.04M across 16 orders, with the strongest growth in
July. Sales increased positively with an increase in marketing expenditure for each sales team,
though efficiency varied by team and region. The East region achieved the highest sales with
their advertising campaign while the West region performed the worst with their campaign.

## Recommendations

The data suggests that the East region leverages their advertising campaign well while the West region underperforms. In order to increase sales, the East region should communicate their practices to the West region to increase sales while maintaining a low marketing expenditure.
